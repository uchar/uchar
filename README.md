## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on an open source project call Q2a.js in my free times. 

It's basically a really fast and seo friendly forum/blog framework on top of Next.js - Which is great at server side rendering.
 
My plan for it is to build an elegant and fast js framework for people who needs a forum/blog/support system/documentation system.

https://github.com/uchar/Q2A.js

I will be more than happy if anyone wants to contribute. 

I'm also a game developer too! And currently working on a fun hyper casual game called Fruity.io

My main experience and knowledge is in AWS services/Node.js/React.js/React.Native/Unity

If there is anything that I can help with, email me at omid.es73@gmail.com
