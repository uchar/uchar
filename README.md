## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Omid , I work as a fullstack developer and also game developer during the day and opensource developer during the nights

My main experience and knowledge is in AWS services/Node.js/React.js/React.Native/Next.js/Unity

If there is something that I can help with, don't hesitate to email me : omid.es73@gmail.com .

As the opensource part of my job ,I'm currently working on an open source project call Q2a.js in my free times. It's basically a [fast and seo friendly framework](https://github.com/uchar/Q2A.js) to create your own forum/blog on top of Next.js.
